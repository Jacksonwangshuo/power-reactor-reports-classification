# power-reactor-reports-classification

Conducted web crawling of power reactor reports data from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and transformed it into a usable format, enabling the organization to gain valuable insights into reactor performance and safety.

Leveraged advanced NLP techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Document Frequency-Inverse Class Freï¿¾quency (DF-ICF) to perform topic modeling on incident reports. The use of a pre-trained Large Language Model (BERT) further improved classification accuracy, achieving an overall accuracy rate of 80%.
